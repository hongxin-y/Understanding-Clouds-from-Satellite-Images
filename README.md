# Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images

## Abstract

The main purpose of this project is to understand clouds organization given the fix-sized satellite images. The clouds in images can be detected and classified into four patterns, namely Fish, Flower, Sugar and Gravel, each of which has an important research meaning in Meteorology. In this project, we applied two image segmentation methods (UNet and ResNet50-UNet) and a weakly supervised method to classify and segment satellite images. We compare our methods with a baseline (ResNet34-UNet) whose evaluation index is 0.59. Finally, all the classification accuracy of our models are approximately 0.75 and the Dices of our models reach about 0.6.
